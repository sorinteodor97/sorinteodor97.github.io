This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for my personal projects. A separate category is for separate projects.

### Blood vessel segmentation in retinal images using U-net

[Github](https://github.com/sorinteodor97/Blood-vessel-segmentation)

Retinal vessel segmentation algorithms are a fundamental component of automatic retinal disease screening systems. This work involves the usage of U-net type of neural network in order to extract the blood vessels from 2D retinal images acquired from two datasets, Drive and STARE.

## Machine learning

### Phonocardiogram_Classification

[Github](https://github.com/sorinteodor97/Phonocardiogram_Classification)

In this project the goal is to test how accurate an expert system can identify the normal versus abnormal heart sounds.
The signal used is the phonocardiogram, an record of the sounds made by the heart. For this signal developed a system that uses a set of features 
extracted from heart sounds to train a random forest classifier.
