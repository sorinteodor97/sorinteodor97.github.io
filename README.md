### Blood vessel segmentation in retinal images using U-net

[Github](https://github.com/sorinteodor97/Blood-vessel-segmentation)

Retinal vessel segmentation algorithms are a fundamental component of automatic retinal disease screening systems. This work involves the usage of U-net type of neural network in order to extract the blood vessels from 2D retinal images acquired from two datasets, Drive and STARE.
